# neural_networks_scratch
This is a public repository including various implementations of building neural networks from scratch. Here we worked on building some Convonutional Neural Networks using the useful Convolution layer, Max Pooling Layer. We used the elementary method using numpy library and didnt just import the layers from TensorFlow.
